## Background
Model Context Protocol (MCP)
Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocol

### MCP
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) supports two primary transport mechanisms: stdio and Streamable HTTP (formerly SSE), each suited to different deployment scenarios.

**STDIO transport**
In the stdio mode, the MCP server operates as a local subprocess, communicating with the client through standard input and output streams. This setup offers minimal latency and full-duplex messaging, making it ideal for local integrations such as command-line tools or applications running on the same machine. Messages are encoded using JSON-RPC and are delimited by newlines, ensuring efficient and straightforward communication. This transport is particularly beneficial when network overhead needs to be minimized and when both client and server reside on the same host .

**Streamable HTTP transport**
The Streamable HTTP transport replaces the earlier SSE approach and allows the MCP server to function as an independent process accessible over the network. Clients send JSON-RPC messages via HTTP POST requests, while the server can push responses and notifications back through a persistent HTTP connection. This method facilitates remote access, browser compatibility, and easier traversal through firewalls. It's well-suited for scenarios where the client and server are on different machines or when integrating with web-based applications .

**Choosing between STDIO and Streamable HTTP**
The choice between stdio and Streamable HTTP depends on the specific requirements of your application:

- STDIO: Best for local, high-performance use cases where low latency and simplicity are paramount.

- Streamable HTTP: Ideal for remote or distributed applications requiring broader accessibility and compatibility with web technologies.

By selecting the appropriate transport mechanism, developers can optimize the performance and accessibility of their MCP implementations.
